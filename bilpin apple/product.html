  <h2>Pink Lady</h2>
  <div class="desc">
  Cripps Pink is a cultivar of apple.
 It is one of several cultivars from which apples
  that meet quality standards can be sold under the trade mark
   name Pink Lady.  Cripps Pink was originally bred by John Cripps
    at the (then named) Western Australia Department of Agriculture by
 crossing the Australian apple Lady Williams with a Golden Delicious to
  combine the firm long-storing property of Lady Williams with the
   sweetness and lack of storage scald of Golden Delicious.</div>
