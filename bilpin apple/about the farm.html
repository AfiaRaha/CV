    <p>We are a family run business that is third generation apple farmers. My husband and I have been farming for over 35 years. Our two sons have come into the business and are eager to bring new and fresh ideas to our business. Our farm is nestled in the heart of Bilpin, We are the biggest Orchard in Bilpin with thousands of trees to pick from. We take pride in our fruit and only grow quality apples. We are suited in a quiet and tranquil street so you can get a real feel for the country lifestyle without all the noise of the city. Come and experience a great day out with family or friends. Once you have picked your fruit you might like to visit The Pines Orchard Café for some Hot Food, Tea or Coffee with some delicious
 homemade Apple Pies, Scones or Slices and much more……….</p>
